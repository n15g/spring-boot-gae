## Requirements

* Java 8+
* Appengine Standard Java 8+
* Gradle 4+ (if you don't want to use the wrapper)

This library has been designed to work with the new Java8 Appengine Standard Environment. It will not work
when deployed to the Java 7 standard environment.

## Getting Started

### SearchRepository
Repositories extending`SearchRepository` will automatically index saved entities in the `SearchService` using
the entity's `Key#toWebSafeKey()` as the `@SearchId`.

### Google Search API Limitations

There are some limitations of the the google Search API that impact what can and cannot be indexed or queried
by the `SearchService`:

* Collections are not supported on NUMBER or DATE fields.
* Date/Time fields are stored and queried as DATE only, the time component is truncated.
* Substring matching is not supported.
* GT, GTE, LT, LTE are not supported for STRING/HTML queries.

Not all of the limitations of the Search API are enforced by the framework, if in doubt see the
[Search API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/java/search/) for specifics.
